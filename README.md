# Pigging Operations History and Schedule
Thinkful fullstack capstone project, a Pipeline Pigging Operations History and Schedule app, which allows pigging activities to be historized and scheduled.

## Introduction

This application will replace the current Pigging History and Schedule, an Excel workbook that contains the history of pigging activities of over 120 pipelines. This document is also used to create a daily Pigging Schedule.

The pigging report and schedule is completed in three parts every day:

Part 1: Individual Daily Reports are completed by Pipeline Operators and sent to me via email. These Daily Reports are in Excel format and contain a few formulas and drop down menus to make the Daily reports easier for the operators to use.

Part 2: The Daily Reports are compiled into one master Daily Report (by manually copying/pasting data), which is stored as a page in the Pigging History workbook.

Part 3: The Pigging Schedule is sent out each day to a mailing list of schedule viewers.


## User Stories

This application will be utilized by five different types of users: Pipeline Operators,  Pipeline Foremen, Production Foremen, Managers, and Contractors who view the pigging schedule.
